The Wild Pokemon are programmed to remain in place until one of the trainers starts moving. If the trainer walks within a 2 step range of the wild pokemon, the pokemon will begin chasing the trainer and will attack the trainer when its on the same location. If a trainer has stopped within two steps of the pokemon, advancing time will not move the wild pokemon towards the trainer. The trainer must be moving!


#Added a legendary pokemon class. This pokemon has more health and a higher attack. It also has a special attack feature which randomly changes the attack. Legendary Pokemon can also fly
